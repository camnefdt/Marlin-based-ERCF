# Marlin-based-ERCF
Develop a system that can run ERCF multi fillament directly on almost any 3d printer mainboard

This project will allow the multi material system ERCF-Enraged Rabbit Carot Feeder, to be run directly from Creality ender 3 mainboards with no extensive modifications or need to change firmware.
